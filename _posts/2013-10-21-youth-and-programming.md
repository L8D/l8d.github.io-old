January 4th, 2013, was the first day of real public school I ever had. Until
then I was either homeschooled, in a short-term private school, or in
kindergarten for my acedemia. That first day felt almost like a first day of
school, and I can imagine anyone understanding why. On that first day, I met
a lot of people, and on that day I learned a lot about them too. I honestly
didn't know what to expect from 13 year olds.

During my days in homeschool I only got to meet other homeschoolers, and still
not that many of them. In retrospect, these &lsquo;homerschoolers&rsquo; seemed
to be&mdash; to put it bluntly &mdash;smarter than the students I met at public
schools. However, most of them were very close-minded, sheltered, and living
under the overprotection of their highly Christian parents.

Some time long ago my parents allowed me to use a computer(and most notably,
the internet) freely. From there I got to experience a lot of things about the
&lsquo;real&rsquo;-world that I realized my parents were shielding from me, and
I perfectly understood why.  This awkward self-awareness at an early age made
me feel better than all the other kids, because I *got* the dirty jokes my dad
would say and I was able to argue through my parents reasoning in several
situations.

At one point, I think in the 6th grade, I started taking my classes online.
They called them &ldquo;virtual schools&rdquo;, and basically for each subject
I had a different teacher that I could email, call, and submit assignments too.
This introduced a new era of independence in my life as I was fully responsible
for the work I did in school. But what I just said isn't really important.

Because I spent long periods of time at my desk, at my computer, I would get
bored. I was bored to the point where I didn't want to walk away from my desk,
as I still had work to do, but I didn't want to do the work. Thus,
procrastination occured. Instead of visiting websites and stuff though, I
decided I wanted to try and make my experience in using the computer better.
I'm not entirely sure where it went from there, but I do know I somehow ended
up downloading XCode and learning C via
[cplusplus.com](http://www.cplusplus.com/). That's where it all started.

Eventually through the two grades of middle school that I attended virtually, I
picked up on a decent amount of things about computers. I
[got into linux](http://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/search?q=author%3AL8D&sort=new&restrict_sr=on), I picked up on dozens of languages, I even started learning
some X86 Assembly. Then September 2012 had to roll around and mess stuff up.

Basically, my family had to move across a few states back to where we lived
7 years beforehand. Let's just say we went through some financial troubles and
settled in a small house in Austin(my current residence). The first few months
we struggled a little bit but ended up coming through with enough money each
month, but this meant that I would have no money to buy all those expensive
electronics kids' these days want.

I decided I wanted to make some money, so I went to a contracting site
called [oDesk](htttp://odesk.com), signed up, and started doing real world
software development, which was surprisingly easier than doing open source
stuff. So, up until mid-winter I did contract-work at a pretty good hourly
rate.

Here's where the title(or what should've been the title) of this post comes in
to play. Since my parents were busy, and the &ldquo;virtual school&rdquo; for
Texas students was expensive, my parents decided it I should go to public
school, which is why my first day of a real public school was in January.

Anyways, here's my na&iuml;ve self in a public school environment. Now
remember, I've been homeschooled my entire life before this, I have an actual
job, and I know a lot about computers. My Rubik's cube and notebook full of
Closure and Haskell that I wrote in or solved to pass the time called
everyone's attention to me. I hated it.

There was this one possy of students who called me a: &ldquo;proligy.&rdquo; No
typos there. These kids knew the correct pronounciation of the word and
purposely mispoke it just to have that meaning that they were less educated
than me. I made no intentional efforts to stand out, to prove myself smarter
than the other students, or to intimidate other students.

I felt terrified of myself, every student in the 8th grade knew who I was as
this &ldquo;next Einstein&rdquo; or the worst: &ldquo;Sheldon.&rdquo; Even
though everybody thought that calling me a prodigy of some sort was a
compliment, I still felt bullied in a way. Everyone would have this attitude of
&ldquo;oh there's this super smart kid, so let's *respect* him.&rdquo; People
would let me cut to the front of the lunch line, or even offered to carry my
backpack which worried me.

For the teachers though, it was a different story. My mother emailed a teacher
at one point about something and ended up explaining that I knew a lot about
computers. That teacher completely miss-interpreted what she said and thought
that I was a cyber-criminal and the only reason I'm not homeschooled is because
I &ldquo;can't be trusted with computers.&rdquo;

This news traveled around the school pretty fast and every teacher knew about
me and only let me on the computers when I was under close monitor. I had some
writings about [Brainf***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) in my
notebook and it was taken away from me because they genuinely thought I was
writing a virus. But that's a story for another time.

Now, I'm 13, in my freshman year, and no one besides the few people who
remember me from the 8th grade know who I really am, and I'm happy(except this
stupid Computer Science class prerequisite I have to take). I'm still doing contract
jobs on oDesk with my employers knowing nothing about my age, however my hours
are largely cut back because I have school. And GitHub still doesn't let me
override pygments do now my code blocks look like utter crap.

```javascript
function Context(scope, parent) {
    this.scope = scope;
    this.parent = parent;
}

Context.prototype.get = function(ident) {
    if(ident in this.scope)
        return this.scope[ident];
    else if(this.parent)
        return this.parent.get(ident);
};
```

I also should've written more about the way students think of me, but it's 3:51
AM in Austin as I'm writing this, so I'm going to bed.
